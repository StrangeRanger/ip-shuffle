The MTD technique that were working towards is IP shuffling, to make 
lateral movement reconnaissance much more difficult. This strategy 
involves the dynamic changing of IP addresses of systems on a network. 
In our model, we have a private subnet containing 3 virtual machines. 
These machines perform IP address rotation, executing erratic or periodic
shifts across a 254 different IP addresses. Furthermore, our diagram 
illustrates an instance where one of these computers, denoted as Computer 1,
has been compromised. By continuously changing IP addresses in an 
unpredictable manner, IP shuffling impedes the reconnaissance efforts of 
attackers, making it difficult for them to pinpoint and exploit vulnerabilities.
The diagram delineates the intricate architecture of our network infrastructure, 
illustrating the hierarchical arrangement of networks, subnets, and their 
corresponding topological relationships. Within this schematic representation, 
the affected computer is depicted, providing a visual reference to its 
position within the broader network.
