This paper introduces a Bash script designed as a Moving Target Defense (MTD) mechanism for dynamically assigning a random IP address to a computer’s network interface, thereby complicating lateral movement reconnaissance. The IP-shuffle script generates a random IP address within a specified range, verifies its availability, and ensures proper configuration. By unpredictably rotating IP addresses within a subnet, the IP-shuffle script disrupts attackers’ ability to establish a static view of the network, making reconnaissance challenging. This paper evaluates the impact of IP-shuffle in mitigating network reconnaissance and lateral movement, offering insights into its effectiveness as a proactive defense strategy.
