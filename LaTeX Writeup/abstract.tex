This paper introduces a Bash script designed as a Moving Target Defense (MTD) mechanism for dynamically assigning a random IP address to a computerâ€™s network interface, thereby complicating lateral movement reconnaissance. The IP-shuffle script generates a random IP address within a specified range, verifies its availability, and ensures proper configuration. It achieves efficient and reliable IP address assignment through distinct functions for IP address generation, availability verification, network configuration validation, and gateway reachability testing. By unpredictably rotating IP addresses within a subnet, the IP-shuffle script disrupts attackers' ability to establish a static view of the network, making reconnaissance challenging. It incorporates comprehensive error handling and compatibility with Linux and BSD systems to provide a practical solution for scenarios requiring dynamic IP address allocation and streamlined network management. This paper evaluates the impact of IP-shuffle in mitigating network reconnaissance and lateral movement, offering insights into its effectiveness as a proactive defense strategy.
