In the rapidly evolving field of cybersecurity, attackers constantly refine their reconnaissance and lateral movement techniques to compromise networked systems. Moving Target Defense (MTD) strategies have emerged as a proactive solution to complicate and thwart such attacks by introducing uncertainty and unpredictability into network operations. MTD aims to render attackers' collected intelligence ineffective by dynamically altering the attack surface, such as netowrk and system configurations~\cite{8805766}.
One such MTD technique is known as IP shuffling, which involves dynamically changing the IP addresses of systems within a network to impede reconnaissance. This paper introduces the \texttt{ip-shuffle} script, a Bash-based tool that dynamically assigns random IP addresses to a computer’s network interface within a specified range, verifies its availability, and ensures proper configuration. By unpredictably rotating IP addresses within a subnet, the \texttt{ip-shuffle} script disrupts attackers’ ability to establish a static view of the network, making reconnaissance challenging. The script achieves efficient and reliable IP address assignment through distinct functions for IP address generation, availability verification, network configuration validation, and gateway reachability testing. The \texttt{ip-shuffle} script incorporates comprehensive error handling and compatibility with Linux and BSD systems to provide a basic solution for scenarios requiring dynamic IP address allocation.
