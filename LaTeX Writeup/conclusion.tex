Moving Target Defense (MTD) is a "game-changing" theme in cybersecurity that involves creating mechanisms and strategies that are diverse, continually shifting, and changing over time to increase complexity and costs for attackers, limit the exposure of vulnerabilities, and increase system resiliency~\cite{cai2016introduction}.. The IP-shuffle script provides a robust solution for dynamically allocating random IP addresses to network interfaces, a critical component of network security strategies aimed at deterring potential attackers.
Leveraging Bash scripting, the IP-shuffle script offers functionalities for generating random IP addresses, checking their availability, and validating network configurations, ensuring efficient and reliable IP address assignment. It also incorporates error-handling capabilities and Unix signal responsiveness, enhancing reliability during execution and strengthening network resilience. Its modular design allows for easy adaptation to different network setups, making it a valuable tool for automating network interface configuration tasks.
The IP-shuffle script embodies the concept of IP shuffling, a technique designed to complicate attackers' reconnaissance efforts by constantly changing IP addresses unpredictably. By dynamically assigning random IP addresses, IP-shuffle enhances proactive defense strategies, increasing the difficulty for attackers to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.
